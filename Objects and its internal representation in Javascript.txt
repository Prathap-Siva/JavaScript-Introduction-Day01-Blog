Objects: The Building Blocks of JavaScript
In JavaScript, objects are composite data types that group together key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are often referred to as properties, where each property has a name (or key) and a corresponding value. This structure allows developers to represent complex entities in a concise and organized manner. Objects can represent anything from a simple person's profile to more intricate structures like a webpage's Document Object Model (DOM).

Creating Objects
There are multiple ways to create objects in JavaScript. One of the most common methods is by using object literals:

Internal Representation of Objects
Under the hood, how does JavaScript represent objects? JavaScript engines, such as V8 (used in Chrome) or SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), manage objects efficiently by utilizing memory and data structures.

1. Property Names and Values:
JavaScript objects store their properties in a hash table-like structure. The property names (keys) are hashed to improve access time, ensuring that retrieval and manipulation of properties are efficient even for large objects.

2. Prototypes:
Prototypes are a crucial part of JavaScript's object-oriented nature. Each object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is essentially another object. If a property is not found in the current object, the JavaScript engine searches for the property in the prototype chain. This allows for the creation of shared properties and methods among objects, promoting code reusability.

3. Hidden Classes and Inline Caching:
Modern JavaScript engines optimize property access through techniques like hidden classes and inline caching. Hidden classes are generated by the engine to speed up property access. When properties are added to an object in the same order, the engine assigns the object a hidden class, improving property lookup performance. Inline caching is another optimization where the engine caches property accesses to avoid repetitive hash lookups.

4. Garbage Collection:
JavaScript engines also manage memory through garbage collection. Objects that are no longer reachable (i.e., they can't be accessed through any variable or reference) are automatically removed from memory to free up resources.
